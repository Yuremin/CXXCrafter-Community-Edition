Among the 100 projects in the empirical study at that time, 14 projects failed due to unresolved source code errors or exceeding the four-hour build time limit.

By searching for keywords in the error messages within the corresponding GitHub issues, we identified potential build errors in 9 projects. Seven of these remain unresolved (as of 2024-12-05). Two projects, Codon and MuseScore, have been resolved, with MuseScore being fixed after our study was completed.

The details are provided in the table below.
