# **CXXCrafter: An Automated C/C++ Project Build Tool**

**CXXCrafter** is an automated build tool for C/C++ projects that leverages the implicit knowledge and semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Powered by a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, it extracts build-related information from project repositories, then generates and iteratively refines Dockerfiles until the project is successfully built.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Build System Compatibility:**  
  Supports a wide range of mainstream C/C++ build systems and scripts, including Make, CMake, Autotools, Ninja, Meson, Bazel, Xmake, Build2, Vcpkg, as well as Python and Shell-based setups.

- **Automated Build Entry Detection:**  
  Automatically identifies the build entry point without requiring manual configuration.

- **Customizable Build Solutions:**  
  Users can specify particular build requirements, and CXXCrafter will tailor the build process accordingly.

- **High Build Success Rate:**  
  Evaluated on a broad set of popular GitHub repositories, CXXCrafter achieves an overall success rate of over 70%, effectively addressing many challenges of manual builds.

- **High Throughput Efficiency:**  
  Designed to process large volumes of projects in parallel, significantly improving automation throughput.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuremin/CXXCrafter.git
   ```

2. **Environment setup:**  
   CXXCrafter requires **Python 3.9 or higher**.  
   You can optionally use a virtual environment manager like [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## üì¶ Usage Example

1. **Prepare the project list:**  
   Save the absolute or relative paths of the C/C++ projects you wish to build into a text file, for example:

   ```
   projects/gcc
   projects/8cc
   projects/codon
   projects/mold
   projects/clang
   projects/llvm-project
   projects/emacs-gdb
   ...
   ```

2. **Run CXXCrafter:**

   ```bash
   cd CXXCrafter
   python3 src/run.py --project_path_list=path_to_your_project_list.txt
   ```

3. **Check results:**  

   - Successfully generated Dockerfiles will be stored in `./build_solution_base`.
   - Build logs and history can be found in `./dockerfile_playground` and `./logs`, respectively.
